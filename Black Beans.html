        <Strong> When do I plant them?:</Strong> Black beans should be planted in late-Spring, so around April is best.

    <p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-size: 30px">
        <Strong> How do I plant them?:</Strong> Black beans are grown from dried beans opposed to seeds. They're best suited to warm (20-27C), well drained soils, with a 6-6.5ph. Soak the dry beans overnight in clean, fresh water. If you want a continuous harvest, you shouldn plant "pole beans", but if you'd rather harvest them all at once plant a bush. Plant the beans 1 inch deep, with the eye facing down. Only water these when the soil is noticeably dry.
