        Loam is often the best soil to use, preferably a mixture of 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay, but other soils can work depending on the crop.

        Luckily for us here in Ireland, most soil is a neutral PH, which is suitible for most plants. You can test your soil by buying a soil testing kit, which are availible at most garden centers. If your soil is alkaline (over 7 on the PH scale or blue on a litmus strip), you can change this by adding sulfur or gypsum, if it is acidic however (below 7 on the PH scale or red on a litmus strip), you can solve this by adding woodash or lime.
