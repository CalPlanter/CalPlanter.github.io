        <Strong> How do I plant them?:</Strong> Chickpeas are grown from chickpea seeds, which resemble dried out chickpeas. This plant enjoys warm soils, so try not to over-water them. You may notice a red liquid on the leaves when it is hot out, use gloves to clean this as it is malic acid, and can cause irritation to the skin. Chickpeas are ready to harvest when they're big enough to eat, and each pod will usually contain 1, 2 or 3 chickpeas.
