    <p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-size: 30px">
        <Strong> How do I plant them?:</Strong> Kidney beans are grown from seeds, in loose, well-draining soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. We reccomend you grow from seedlings instead of raw seeds, but both can work. Like the <a href="file:///C:/Users/pixel/source/repos/BTeola%C3%AD%C3%93g/BTeola%C3%AD%C3%93g/HTML%20pages/Crops/Spring/Black%20Beans.html">Black bean</a>, it can be grown on a trellis or a bush. Water the plants when it becomes noticeably dry, and harvest when the beans are a yellow hue with a dry touch.. Once you're ready to harvest them, dry them out ina warm, dry spot for a few days, or until the pods harden. Once you remove the beans from the hardened pod, boil them for at least 30 minutes.
