        <strong> When should I plant it?:</strong> Garlic is usually planted in late Autumn or winter, even some varieties in spring! However, we'd reccomend Hardneck garlic, which can survive the cold easier.

        <Strong> How do I plant them?:</Strong> Garlic is a plant that is best planted in somewhere warm, sunny and fertile, will well-drained <a href="file:///C:/Users/pixel/source/repos/BTeola%C3%AD%C3%93g/BTeola%C3%AD%C3%93g/HTML%20pages/Soil.html">soil in a large container (multipurpose compost is best)</a> Use bulb from a garden centre or seed seller instead of the ones you can buy from a supermarket, and break those up into cloves. Plant the large ones 2.5cm deep with the fatter end in the soil. Garlic is a plant that is best suited for high nitrogen feed, such a chicken pellets. You should give this to the plant from April (when you see strong growth). You can harvest them in July, but make sure to sun-dry them for a few days before storing.
