    <p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-size: 30px">
        <Strong> How do I plant them?:</Strong>  Rosemary seeds are first planted in a small pot/container(we'd reccomend terracotta as it allows the plant to dry out faster). Rosemary thrives in dry, warm weather, so a sandy, well drained soil is reccomended. Only water the plant when the soil is noticeably dry. Much like other herbs, you can grow more Rosemary by trimming and placing the trimmings in a peat moss/perlite mix. Make sure to spray with water until it begins to sprout! One final warning, Rosemary cannot survive below freezing(0C), so look out for that
